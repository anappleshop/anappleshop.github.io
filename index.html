        <p class="paragraph">To address the problem space, I designed a <strong class="bold-text---white">money pool feature </strong>that promotes and provides easy pre-trip money planning for travellers. Before the trip, users can set up a money pool in their Splitwise group and a money manager will collect the trip funds. During the trip, pooled money will be spent. When the trip ends, remaining balances can be quickly reconciled to each member.<br></p>

      <p class="image-description">The following sections of the case study continued as a <strong>personal project</strong> after completing a semester of study abroad at the National University of Singapore in Fall 2019.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">Studying abroad shaped the way I view Splitwise </h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Catching spontaneous flights to the craziest places in South-East Asia over the weekends and using the Splitwise App frequently with new friends, I had the opportunity to gain product insights from the user&#x27;s perspective. <strong class="bold-text---splitwise">This experience allowed me to see the app through a new lens and helped me identify disconnects between our first design solution and the user&#x27;s mental model</strong>. It only took me being 7,962 miles away from home for me to realize I had made the mistake of assuming what my user wants without sufficient research, but this experience challenged me to be an agile thinker.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">Three Key Takeaways from Using the Splitwise App Abroad</h4>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-splitwise"><strong class="bold-text-16">01.</strong> Our initial design would require significant stakeholder buy-in from vendors &amp; users, need on-demand internet connection (which some vendors may not have), and involve in-store scanners.<br></blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-splitwise"><strong class="bold-text-16">02.</strong> Many of Splitwise&#x27;s user base are travellers; this user segment prefers cash payments when making purchases abroad due to high international credit card transaction fees.</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-splitwise"><strong class="bold-text-16">03.</strong> Splitwise does not have the core competencies and technology infrastructure to compete in the FinTech space. Diversifying into this space would require significant engineering costs.</blockquote>
      <div class="after-persona"></div>
      <h4 class="heading-4">Traveling is a large use case of the Splitwise app that I had initially overlooked </h4>
      <p class="paragraph">In Singapore, the university organized a Facebook group for foreign exchange and international students to converse and form travel groups. I had to chance to speak to a majority of my travel buddies about their background, travel process, and Splitwise experience through this Facebook group. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to observe how they utilized the app to engage and interact with friends during trips. <br></p>

      <h4 class="heading-4">Opportunity: travel groups often organize shared expenses prior their trips</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The following is the typical user journey of how travel groups manage shared expenses. The current app enables travellers to record and split expenses after the purchase has been made. However, many travellers like Jasmine actually plan their purchases ahead, prior to the trip. This pre-trip money organization is an opportunity for Splitwise to intervene.</p>

      <h4 class="heading-4">Value Proposition</h4>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Splitwise Pool</strong> allows travellers like Jasmine to manage group expenses with ease. Rather than replacing Jasmine&#x27;s current bill-splitting process, Splitwise Money Pool <strong class="bold-text---splitwise">supports her group&#x27;s current workflow</strong> of creating and managing an initial money pool.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">Design Decisions</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Common Design Patterns were leveraged to aid user decisions and support their goals. I applied design principles like visibility of system status to support a match between the system model and the ideal mental model.</p>
      <h6 class="heading-6">User Onboarding</h6>

      <h6 class="heading-6">Confronting challenges</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The Splitwise Feature design taught me to accept my failures, learn from my mistakes and strive to do better. Spending hours on our initial design, I had to accept the challenge of going back to the drawing board. Through this iterative process, I have learned to be an agile thinker and gained insight of the fast-paced, innovative nature of the tech space.</p>
      <h6 class="heading-6">Putting myself in the user&#x27;s shoes</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">As a design student, I always knew the importance of empathy. What I did not know was the difficultly of acquiring a substantial level of empathy to drive design decisions. Oftentimes, just asking what the user would do in certain use cases is not enough. Now, I strive to experience products through the eyes of (new) users, to feel their nuanced frustrations; and to not allow any preconceived notions affect my design approach.</p>
      <h6 class="heading-6">Cultural experiences influence how we design</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">This project is a profound example of how cultural experiences can shape the way one approaches design. Studying abroad in Singapore was a remarkable challenge, but it was perhaps the greatest opportunity for me to understand how people from around the world behave differently, and yet, still manage find ways to connect beyond borders.</p>
